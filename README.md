# Awesome VBA ![VBALogo](./resources/VBALogo.png) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) 

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an implementation of Microsoft's event-driven programming language Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) built into most desktop Microsoft Office applications.

This is a curated list of Libraries and Resources for both VBA and VB6.

## Symbology

Because of the nature of VBA, many libraries do not work on all Operating Systems, in all Office Applications or in all architectures(x64/x86). Some libraries may also require external resources (DLL, Addins, etc.) which can be difficult to use due to VBA's lack of a package manager.  To help you in finding projects suitable for your needs, this awesome list uses the following symbology. The symbology also has tooltips which may provide more information.

#### Platform Compatibility
